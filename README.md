# Digital Forensics
 Digital Forensics project created in Python

## Description 

### The purpose of this project was to recover some deleted information off of a disk image and write up a report on it. The different file structures presented here are NTFS, FAT-16, and FAT-32. A python program was developed to take advantage of the different characteristics of these file structures. In general, certain hex values were analyzed to determine if there was deleted data, if there was, then the data was extracted. See attached report for further details.

## Contents

### - Recovered Files folder includes the contents of the recovered disk image
### - FileRecovery.py is a program that will scan a disk image and recover deleted files from it.
### - Project Report.pdf includes more in depth details on the project details and how the program works.

## Challenges

### - Understanding unique file structures
### - Understanding the layout of a storage device
### - Learning how to encrpyt/decrypt
### - Becoming more comfortable analyzing hexidecimal values
