# Digital Forensics
 Digital Forensics project created in Python

## Description 

### The purpose of this project was to recover some deleted information off of a disk image and write up a report on it. The different file structures presented here are NTFS, FAT-16, and FAT-32. A python program was developed to take advantage of the different characteristics of these file structures. In general, certain hex values were analyzed to determine if there was deleted data, if there was, then the data was extracted. See attached report for further details.
